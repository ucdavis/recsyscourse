\chapter{Linear Models}  
\label{chap:linmod}

In Section \ref{rholargesmall} we made reference to \textit{linear
models}.  Directly or indirectly, they form the basis for much of ML.

Say we are predicting a variable $Y$ from $p$ features, $X_1,...,X_p$.
Let $X$ denote the (column) vector of those features.  We will also
add a constant 1 at the beginning, setting

\begin{equation}
\widetilde{X} = (1,X_1,...,X_p)' 
\end{equation}
