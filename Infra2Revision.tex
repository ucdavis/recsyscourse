\chapter{Some Infrastructure: Probability, Statistics and Regression
Analysis}
\label{chap:infra2}

Many RS methods are probabilistic in nature, so we will lay out some
infrastructure.  It is assumed the reader has a background in
calculus-based probability structures, such as expected value and
density functions.  Background in statistics (as opposed to probability)
and machine learning is \textit{not} assumed.\footnote{The reader may
wish to consult my open source book on probability and statistics, N.
Matloff, \textit{From Algorithms to Z-Scores: Probability and
Statistical Modeling in Computer Science},
\url{http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/probstatbook}.}

Note that while we will develop some statistical methods here, notably
regression and classification models, we will not cover
\textit{inferential} statistical methods such as confidence intervals
and significance tests.  For readers familiar with such topics,
occasional footnotes will be provided. 

This chapter will lay some groundwork, after which we will devote the
following chapter to the crucial concept of \textit{overfitting}.
